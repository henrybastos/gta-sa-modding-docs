title: About the project
description: Its purpose and its content
---

The intention of this project is to show some snippets of mod made for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, documenting code and approaches, like a blog, where each post talks about tackling some specific problem.

These docs work more like notes than a full proper documentation, so the examples might not appear complete, missing some information, acting more like a personal knoledge base.

# Getting started

For compiling and/or running the game, there are X shortcuts:

`F6`: It compiles the scripts.
`F7`: It compiles the scripts AND run the game.
`Ctrl + F7`: Just runs the game (without compiling any script).
